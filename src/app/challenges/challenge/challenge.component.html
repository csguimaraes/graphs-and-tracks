					Imagine that someone has set up an arrangement of tracks on which they have rolled a ball.
					The position, velocity and accelerations shown here represent the ballâ€™s motion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Try to discover the arrangement by examining the challenge graphs by adjusting the tracks yourself and rolling the ball.
					Set the initial position and initial velocity of the ball by clicking on the scales. Raise or lower the posts as necessary.
					Then click Roll Ball to see the resulting graphs for your trial motion.
